## üéØ **ORIGINAL ISSUES FIXED**

### 1. ‚úÖ **Shopping Agent Keyword Issue - FIXED**
**Problem**: The task "find best laptop prices" was incorrectly routed to Research Agent instead of Shopping Agent  
**Solution**: Enhanced shopping keywords with:
- **Multi-word phrases**: "find best", "best price", "find price", "compare price"
- **Product categories**: laptop, phone, computer, tablet, electronics, etc.
- **Improved scoring**: "laptop" now gets 4 points, "find best" gets 6 points (3√ó2 for multi-word)

**Result**: 
- Shopping score: 15 points (prices=5, find best=6, laptop=4)
- Research score: 5 points (find=3, best=2)
- **Shopping agent now correctly selected** ‚úÖ
