**Fix Applied:**
```bash
npm rebuild better-sqlite3
```
**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED
**Test Result:** Database service now initializes correctly

### ⚠️ Issue #2: TypeScript Compilation Error (CRITICAL)  
**Location:** `/app/src/main/components/ErrorBoundary.tsx:68`  
**Problem:** Condition checking function existence instead of function result  
**Code Issue:**
```typescript
// BEFORE (buggy)
if (window.electronAPI?.sendAIMessage) {
  
// AFTER (fixed)  
if (window.electronAPI && typeof window.electronAPI.sendAIMessage === 'function') {
```
**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED
**Test Result:** TypeScript compilation now clean
